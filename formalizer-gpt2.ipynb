        "# 🚀 Recommended Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "To further improve the formality translation model, consider these advanced techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Architecture Improvements\n",
        "- **Larger Models**: Experiment with GPT-2 large or GPT-Neo for improved performance\n",

        "\n",
        "## 2. Data Enhancements\n",
        "- **Data Augmentation**: Create synthetic examples by applying rule-based formality transformations\n",
        "- **Active Learning**: Collect human feedback on model outputs to improve training data\n",
        "- **Contrastive Learning**: Train the model to distinguish between formal and informal texts\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Training Refinements\n",
        "- **Hyperparameter Search**: Use Bayesian optimization to find optimal training parameters\n",
        "- **Reinforcement Learning**: Apply RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) for better outputs\n",
        "- **Curriculum Learning**: Start with simple transformations and gradually increase complexity\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Evaluation Enhancements\n",
        "- **Human Evaluation**: Set up a blind test with human judges to rate formality and adequacy\n",
        "- **Style Transfer Metrics**: Implement specialized metrics for formality transfer like F-BLEU\n",
        "- **Classifier-based Evaluation**: Train a formal/informal classifier and use it to score outputs\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Deployment Considerations\n",
        "- **Model Compression**: Quantize the model to 4-bit precision for faster inference\n",
        "- **Caching**: Implement response caching for common inputs\n",
        "- **API Wrapper**: Build a simple REST API for easy integration with applications\n",
