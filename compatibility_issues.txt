TrainingArguments:
Removed unsupported arguments: evaluation_strategy, eval_steps, save_steps, save_total_limit, metric_for_best_model, greater_is_better, optim, warmup_ratio, push_to_hub, report_to, overwrite_output_dir.
Only used basic, widely supported arguments (batch size, learning rate, epochs, logging_steps, fp16, weight_decay, seed, output_dir).

SFTTrainer:
Removed unsupported arguments: tokenizer, callbacks, and max_seq_length.
Only used: model, args, train_dataset, and eval_dataset.

Early Stopping:
Could not use EarlyStoppingCallback directly in the trainer due to lack of support for callbacks in this TRL version. Early stopping must be handled manually by monitoring validation loss.

Dataset Preparation:
Ensured the dataset passed to SFTTrainer has a single "text" field, as required by TRL 0.18.2.

General:
All advanced or newer features from recent versions of transformers/TRL were avoided to ensure compatibility with the older APIs.
